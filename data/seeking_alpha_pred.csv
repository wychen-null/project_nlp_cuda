Daniel Jones,2023-03-11 04:53:53-05:00,BMI,"Badger Meter continues to grow, and most of its bottom line figures have been faring well despite economic concerns.The firm's balance sheet is solid, and management has demonstrated time and again that the business is a high-quality operator.But shares are pricey and likely have limited upside, if any, at this point in time.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-12 06:13:26-04:00,JJSF,"J&J Snack Foods has moved lower recently, in spite of sales climbing and because of a worsening on its bottom line.The space the company operates in is large and growing, but this and the lower share price don't make it a good prospect.Given how pricey the shares are, the firm may have additional downside before it's worth considering.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-03-10 04:36:24-05:00,APOG,"Apogee Enterprises continues to post attractive sales, profit, and cash flow growth.It's unclear what the picture holds for the business, but the overall picture looks positive for shareholders at the moment.Given how cheap shares are, additional upside from here is likely warranted.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-10 04:07:20-05:00,HNI,"HNI Corporation has not had a great year or so, with shares of the business falling slightly more than the broader market has.This may signal to some investors that fundamentals are deteriorating, but that's not exactly the case.For the most part, HNI stock looks to be in decent shape, and shares look cheap.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-03-09 20:32:59-05:00,GE,"The management team at General Electric provided investors with a detailed update regarding the company's health and expectations moving forward.The future looks bright, particularly when it comes to the firm's GE Aerospace unit, with plenty of fuel to push sales, profits, and cash flows higher.All things considered, investors should view these developments in a very positive light.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-09 09:24:17-05:00,NPK,"National Presto Industries had something of a mixed year in 2022, with sales ultimately falling, but the second half of the year showing some bright spots.The firm's balance sheet is robust, and the long-term outlook for the business will likely be positive.But given how shares are priced, there are better prospects that can be had on the market today.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-09 08:22:47-05:00,PDCO,"Patterson Companies has had a rather mixed operating history in recent years, with sales climbing, but profits and cash flows posting volatile results.That trend has continued into the 2023 fiscal year, though cash flow data is looking up.The firm may not be the greatest prospect on the market, but it does seem to offer some upside based on how shares are priced today.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-08 20:36:42-05:00,HEES,"H&E Equipment Services has done incredibly well at growing both its top and bottom lines in recent quarters.Acquisitions and strong demand have been the key drivers here, and shares have done well in response.Add on how cheap shares are, and I believe that further upside is warranted from here.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-08 13:02:24-05:00,BWXT,"BWX Technologies has done well from a sales perspective, but bottom line results have been under pressure.Even with this being the case, guidance for 2023 is encouraging, but this doesn't make the company a great prospect.Shares have done well, but upside is limited from here based on how shares are priced today.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-08 05:58:06-05:00,TDUP,"ThredUp announced financial results covering the fourth quarter of the company's 2022 fiscal year that exceeded expectations.This, combined with strong guidance for 2023, sent TDUP shares roaring higher after months of declines.This is great to see and the company is doing better than in the past, but it's not exactly a great prospect right now.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-08 05:11:23-05:00,TNC,"Tennant Company posted some strong sales, profit, and cash flow results recently.The firm expects continued growth through 2023, which should make shares a bit cheaper.TNC stock looks fairly valued compared to similar firms, but it's cheap enough on an absolute basis to warrant further upside.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-07 17:35:36-05:00,VPG,"Vishay Precision Group has done well over the past couple of years, with sales, profits, and cash flows finally rising after years of mixed results.The near-term outlook for the company also looks positive based on sales expectations for the first quarter of this year.Shares are also on the cheap side of the spectrum and, as a result, likely have some upside potential.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-07 11:15:27-05:00,SUP,"Superior Industries International has seen a meteoric rise in recent months, with multiple contributors to its upside.Fundamentally, the company looks to be doing quite well and management seems to expect that to continue.Add on top of this how cheap shares are and the prospect of a buyout, and upside still exists moving forward.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-07 05:21:34-05:00,HOV,"At first glance, Hovnanian Enterprises looks like a dirt-cheap business that has tremendous upside potential.In the long run, the company might very well be fine, but it has a large amount of debt and is seeing signs of additional pain around the corner.Investors would be wise to approach this prospect with caution until we see the depths of this downturn.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-03-06 20:00:11-05:00,RBC,"RBC Bearings continues to show strong growth, both because of its major acquisition and due to organic strength.Long term, the company should fare well for its investors, but RBC stock isn't necessarily a great prospect.As things stand, it's a neutral play in my book because of how shares are priced.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-06 07:51:51-05:00,GIC,"The past several months have not been kind to Global Industrial Company and its investors, with shares tanking compared to the market.This seems to be due to pain on the firm's top and bottom lines in the second half of the year, and because of general concerns about the economy.Despite the pain, pain that is likely to continue near term, shares are looking attractive and probably do have some upside from here.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-03-06 05:41:49-05:00,DORM,"Dorman Products has had something of a lumpy operating history, but sales have done incredibly well in recent years.Current guidance is very bullish and could lead to some upside, but it's still too early to know if the company can deliver on it.At present, DORM shares look to be more or less fairly valued and likely have less upside as a result.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-05 12:48:39-05:00,WOOF,Petco Health and Wellness Company has not fared all that well compared to the broader market.This comes even as sales continue to climb and as bottom line results are mixed but still positive.Shares are cheap and do seem to offer attractive upside from here.,0
Daniel Jones,2023-03-05 06:35:28-05:00,MPX,"Marine Products Corporation has had a great run over the past several months, with shares rising nicely due to robust financial performance.All of the data provided by the company so far indicates little to no real weakness on the horizon.Though shares are lofty compared to similar firms, they do still seem to offer some upside from here.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-04 09:34:46-05:00,GOLF,"The management team at Acushnet Holdings continues to post strong financial results for the company, both on its top and bottom lines.The future for the business also looks bright, with sales, profits, and cash flow likely to rise this year.Shares are also priced low enough to warrant additional upside from here despite rising so much already.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-03 15:47:25-05:00,MLKN,"MillerKnoll has not been treated kindly by the market as of late, with shares falling due to concerns about the future.Near term, the company may see some weakness, but recent financial performance has been solid and shares are cheap.Ultimately, this makes the firm a good prospect for value-oriented investors to consider.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-03-03 05:58:20-05:00,LMNR,"Limoneira Company's fundamental picture is showing signs of improvement, with top line and bottom line results getting better.The firm is also working to pay down debt through asset sales and transitioning toward an asset-light business model.While LMNR stock is far from being a great prospect, it is better than it was only in the middle of last year.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-02 20:46:34-05:00,CVEO,"Civeo Corporation took a beating after announcing mixed financial results and forecasting a weak 2023 fiscal year.It's not surprising that shares of the firm would fall in response to this, but the market isn't valuing the company appropriately.Shares offer additional upside from here so long as operations don't worsen materially moving forward.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-03-02 17:37:50-05:00,BOOT,"Boot Barn Holdings has had a great couple of months, with rising sales pushing shares higher.The firm has faced continued pressure on its bottom line, but the overall picture for the firm is still appealing.Add in that shares are still attractively priced, and it's likely that the firm can still move higher from here.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-02 12:00:00-05:00,ATRI,"Atrion Corporation has done well from a sales perspective very recently, but its overall financial performance in recent years has been disappointing.This is especially true of bottom line results that have shown no real growth.The firm is a stable operator that should be fine in the long run, but the stock is pricey for a company with limited growth.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-03-02 10:21:11-05:00,DKS,"DICK'S Sporting Goods has had some mixed results as of late, though an increase in guidance sent shares of the business higher.Fundamentally speaking, the business looks solid, though we could see some weakness at some point due to continued economic uncertainty.Given how cheap shares are, though, it seems as though the company has additional upside to offer investors right now.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-02 10:20:15-05:00,SFIX,"The management team at Stitch Fix is expected to report financial results covering the second quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year soon.Heading into earnings, analysts seem quite bearish, but so does management.Investors need to pay attention not only to headline news but also to the firm's deteriorating cash position.A cautious approach to the company during this time may not be a bad idea, though it may offer a nice upside if signs of a turnaround emerge.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-03-01 17:19:10-05:00,ONEW,"OneWater Marine continues to grow sales nicely, though the firm has shown some weakness and indicated that some future weakness lies ahead.This may discourage some investors, but the company's overall financial condition looks solid.The stock is also incredibly cheap and likely offers tremendous upside from here.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-01 15:22:46-05:00,PTSI,"P.A.M. Transportation Services is far from a great company, but continued growth has been encouraging.Unfortunately, the business is seeing some weakness across the board, and that is likely to continue.But given how cheap shares are, overall optimism is warranted at this time.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-03-01 08:58:53-05:00,LIND,"Lindblad Expeditions Holdings does continue to recover, but the bottom line results remain under pressure.It doesn't help that Lindblad has a great deal of debt on hand, but it is also true that the business is growing at a nice clip.All things considered, LIND stock could offer upside, but investors should approach the business with caution.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-03-01 07:00:47-05:00,KTB,"Kontoor Brands had a great run higher after management announced financial results covering the final quarter of the company's 2022 fiscal year.Sales and profits both exceeded expectations and management provided positive guidance for 2023.Though the easy money has been made, KTB shares still look attractively priced right now.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-02-28 16:00:34-05:00,SCI,"After a couple of great years caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Service Corporation International is seeing its financial performance pull back some.This may be disappointing to some investors, but the company remains a quality enterprise and its long-term picture should be positive.Shares aren't the cheapest, but they do likely offer some upside from here.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-02-28 09:57:57-05:00,NTGR,"The past few quarters have not been particularly great for Netgear, Inc. and its shareholders, with sales, profits, and cash flows falling.The 2022 fiscal year was quite bad for the business, but one part of Netgear does continue to grow at a nice clip.Long term, the picture for Netgear, Inc. is likely to be fine and the firm has plenty of cash on hand to survive this downturn.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-02-28 07:58:58-05:00,LAZY,"Lazydays Holdings has seen a significant decline in sales as of late, with market demand for RVs plummeting after years of strength.The firm also seems to have excess supply on hand, which could create additional pain moving forward.Add on top of this its hefty debt load, and it wouldn't necessarily be a bad idea for investors to turn cautious on the firm.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-02-27 16:44:08-05:00,GGG,"Graco has had a nice spurt of growth in the past couple of years, with sales, profits, and cash flows climbing higher.The firm's balance sheet also looks solid and its long-term picture is promising.But shares are a bit too lofty to warrant a significant amount of enthusiasm.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-02-27 12:11:18-05:00,MPW,"Medical Properties Trust was hit hard the other day due to reduced expectations regarding the 2023 fiscal year.Though disappointing, this does nothing to change the fact that shares look very cheap right now.The firm may not be as attractive as I previously thought, but its low valuation and continued improvements justify upside moving forward.",0
Daniel Jones,2023-02-27 08:22:04-05:00,J,"Jacobs Solutions has done quite well for itself in recent years, with its transformation yielding positive results.Strong backlog should push sales, profits, and cash flows higher moving forward as well.Shares aren't the cheapest, but they do seem to have some upside potential to them.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-02-27 05:10:23-05:00,RENT,"Rent the Runway continues to post strong sales growth, thanks to a rise in the number of subscribers year-over-year.Bottom line results are also improving, but they are far away from where they need to be.For now, I believe there are better prospects to be had, but the firm could eventually grow into its valuation.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-02-26 08:31:40-05:00,MODG,"Topgolf Callaway Brands continues to grow nicely on both its top and bottom lines.That trend is set to continue and the market has responded positively to this.Shares still look attractively-undervalued, but they aren't as appealing as they were during my previous coverage though, in part due to recent upside.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-02-26 04:56:57-05:00,IBP,"Installed Building Products has had a great run in recent months, with shares roaring higher due to strong sales, profit, and cash flow growth.Shares look quite cheap right now and are fairly cheap compared to similar firms.Given changes in the space and because of the share price move higher, a more cautious approach to the business would not be unwise.",2
Daniel Jones,2023-02-26 04:27:11-05:00,CVGI,"Commercial Vehicle Group has a history of mixed but generally positive financial results.Recently, bottom line results have come under pressure, but this is normal for the company.Shares look cheap enough on an absolute basis to likely have some upside potential associated with it.",0
