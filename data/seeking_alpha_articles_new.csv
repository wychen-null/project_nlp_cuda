Daniel Jones,2023-04-14T16:40:51-04:00,DSKE,"Daseke has had some mixed results as of late, but the company is, on the whole, on a rather solid footing right now. Shares are expensive relative to similar firms, but not materially so. Add in how cheap shares are on an absolute basis and how management views 2023, and there are reasons to remain bullish."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-14T06:24:45-04:00,FHN,"There are fears that the deal that involves TD Bank acquiring First Horizon will fall through because of regulatory concerns and changing economics. These fears are not wholly unreasonable and investors may need to brace themselves for a haircut on the deal. Even with a haircut, though, there does seem to be an upside from here so long as the deal is completed."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-14T06:13:33-04:00,MO,"Altria Group has struggled to grow sales in recent years due to a decline in smoking rates, but its bottom line results have been strong. Investors have shares priced cheaply because of concerns about the company's future. But management is well aware of this and is focusing on transforming the company into something else entirely."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-13T09:12:18-04:00,GE,"The management team at General Electric is due to report financial results for the first quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year later this month. Analysts expect organic revenue to grow, while profits should come in positive compared to last year's negative reading. In all, the company looks like a solid opportunity heading into earnings, even though the stock has already risen so much in recent months."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-13T08:14:56-04:00,TRTN,"Triton International agreed to sell itself to Brookfield Infrastructure in a massive, multi-billion-dollar deal. This move created a significant upside for investors in Triton International, but the transaction doesn't make sense to me. Shares of Triton International still look undervalued, even with this massive premium."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-13T04:33:45-04:00,T,"The management team at AT&T will be announcing on April 20 financial results covering the first quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year. Investors should pay attention to headline news items, but a good amount of emphasis should also be on the company's growth initiatives. The stock is very cheap at this time and debt is likely to decline, making the company a great prospect to consider."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-12T14:56:13-04:00,FRCB,"The management team at First Republic Bank announced that it had decided to suspend the distributions on their preferred stock. This move is a big, but unexpected, blow to holders of those units, and it makes a lot of sense for First Republic Bank to make it. It's telling that this was seemingly voluntary, but it does come with some risk to the business. Investors should view the common stock as being far more attractive than the preferred now."

Daniel Jones,2023-04-12T09:23:52-04:00,DHC,"Shares of both Office Properties Income Trust and Diversified Healthcare Trust fell after news broke that the firms were merging. This transaction is actually really positive for shareholders of DHC, but it's awful for OPI's investors. The stock does look cheap, but the high leverage and problems OPI looks set to inherit make it a risky prospect."

Daniel Jones,2023-04-12T06:27:19-04:00,TUP,"The management team at Tupperware Brands came out with a really bad piece of news for investors. In short, the company's financial condition looks awful due to debt and a significant deterioration in its business. Tupperware doesn't seem to have much in the way of resources to fix or alleviate these issues, and investors should expect the worst."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-11T09:36:11-04:00,COLD,"Americold Realty Trust has underperformed the market in recent months, even as financial performance has been mixed but generally positive. The problem lies in the price of the stock, which is awfully lofty at this point in time. Long term, though, the company should be fine, especially as it grows in international markets."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-11T08:41:19-04:00,CSL,"Shares of Carlisle Companies hit a fresh 52-week low point on April 5th and have only recovered marginally since then. This comes at a time when financial performance is robust and the company's overall health is positive. Add on top of this favorable guidance and how shares are priced, and it's now worth considering."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-10T10:37:36-04:00,TMHC,"The homebuilding market is really taking a hit from an order and backlog perspective. This is due to higher interest rates and the impact of inflation on home buying. Normally, investors might be advised to stay away, but Taylor Morrison Home Corporation shares are cheap enough to create a favorable risk to reward prospect at this time."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-10T00:44:59-04:00,TELL,"Tellurian announced a binding letter of intent involving a $1 billion sale-leaseback transaction. This move could bring a tremendous amount of capital to the company, but the transaction is not guaranteed to go through just yet. There is risk here, and management would be best advised to focus on the company's side business."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-09T08:52:52-04:00,CXT,"Crane NXT was recently spun off from its parent company, Crane Company, as a standalone cash/payments business. Although growth wasn't the best in recent years, management has fuel to grow the company moving forward. Add on top of this, certain catalysts and a low share price, and it definitely warrants consideration."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-09T04:59:07-04:00,LAD,"The management team at Lithia Motors is due to announce financial results for the first quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year in the coming days. Recently, shares have underperformed the market even as sales climb, and this is due to concerns over worsening market conditions. While weakness could lie ahead, I believe it's unlikely that the company would look worse than fairly valued. This translates to a favorable risk-to-reward prospect right now."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-08T00:57:19-04:00,XOM,"At its core, Exxon Mobil is focused on the fossil fuel space, with its operations largely dedicated to oil and gas extraction and refining. To prepare for the future, management is making some big moves that have the potential to pay off significantly. This transformation will prove good for both shareholders and the environment if management can make good on its promises."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-07T08:00:00-04:00,SDRL,"Seadrill reported mixed results for the final quarter of its 2022 fiscal year, with revenue missing but earnings blowing past expectations. The company has done well to pay down debt, and its overall financial condition is undeniably decent. SDRL stock is cheap compared to similar firms but not cheap enough to account for industry risks."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-06T14:13:15-04:00,COST,"The management team at Costco Wholesale announced financial results covering the month of March. Comparable sales demonstrated deterioration compared to results seen earlier in the year, which suggests further weakness lies ahead. The company is a high-quality operator and this decline in price was probably unwarranted, but shares are still not attractive enough to buy."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-06T10:07:31-04:00,BTC-USD,"Recently, both Bitcoin and gold have been on the rise, with many market participants likely seeing both as good places to park their money during uncertain times. Digging deeper, it's likely that Bitcoin is rising because of a more speculation-friendly market that is perceived to be around the corner. Gold's rise has been driven by central bank purchases as opposed to an investor-driven flight to safety. Long term, Bitcoin looks drastically overvalued, but gold is also likely to fall eventually. In all, gold is the better play for investors, though I always prefer going long stocks."

Daniel Jones,2023-04-06T09:00:00-04:00,FRCB,"Both First Republic and Western Alliance have taken a beating this year, as fears mount that they might succumb to contagion following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Each firm is vulnerable in its own way, but we will only know the bigger picture when the businesses report financial results in the coming days. Heading into earnings, Western Alliance looks like a more solid opportunity for investors."

Daniel Jones,2023-04-05T10:08:47-04:00,SPTN,"SpartanNash Company has had some mixed results recently, though sales and some cash flow figures have fared well. The stock also looks cheap, both on an absolute basis and relative to similar firms. Management is focused on growth, but the real opportunity will come from the firm's Retail operations if management focuses there."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-05T08:40:43-04:00,ACI,"There is a good deal of uncertainty right now regarding the planned merger between Albertsons Companies and Kroger. There is a possibility that the firms will need to divest even more stores than previously planned, which increases the risk of a collapse of the deal. Although this would cause investors in Albertsons to miss out on attractive short-term gains, Albertsons is already cheap and deserves to move higher."

Daniel Jones,2023-04-05T00:18:19-04:00,USO,"OPEC+ decided to cut oil production starting in May by 1.16 million barrels per day. This cut should last through the rest of the year and it seems to solve the disparity that existed between OPEC and the EIA. The move higher is warranted, and investors now have plenty of interesting opportunities to consider. The smallest firms moved up the most in response to the news, which indicates an appetite for risk."

Daniel Jones,2023-04-04T12:17:15-04:00,SCHW,"The Charles Schwab Corporation management team is expected to announce financial results covering the first quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year soon. Analysts currently have high expectations, with continued growth and high interest rates likely to help the company significantly. Charles Schwab is stable and its long-term prospects should only improve from here."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-03T16:30:38-04:00,EDR,"Shares of both Endeavor Group Holdings and World Wrestling Entertainment took a hit after news broke that the two firms would merge UFC and WWE into a separate entity. Conceptually, this deal makes a lot of sense and will create a major player in the entertainment space. But the price does not make sense and results in investors in Endeavor Group Holdings giving too much away for what it's receiving."

Daniel Jones,2023-04-03T13:04:14-04:00,WEST,"Westrock Coffee Company, LLC is an interesting business with a focus on coffee and tea products. The firm has done well to grow its topline in recent years, and the markets it operates in are large and growing. But Westrock Coffee Company shares look pricey on an absolute basis, and there are likely better opportunities that can be had."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-03T08:28:28-04:00,ARCB,"ArcBest Corporation has done well, for the most part, from a fundamental perspective over the past several months. The company has seen some weakness on its bottom line, but shares still look cheap enough to warrant upside. Management is also looking to buy back additional stock following an asset sale, which makes sense with how cheap shares currently are."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-02T05:37:57-04:00,LOB,"Shares of Live Oak Bancshares have suffered mightily as of late as concerns over a banking crisis have mounted. Although this may cause investors to worry, Live Oak Bancshares is a solid operator that is likely to hold up well even if the crisis isn't contained. Add in the strong track record of the business, and investors would be wise to consider it as an attractive opportunity."
Daniel Jones,2023-04-01T21:03:43-04:00,RUM,"Shares of Rumble rose nicely after former President Donald Trump was indicted and after reporting strong financial results for the latest quarter. This move higher demonstrates the rapid growth potential of the firm, but this may not be enough for many investors. While growth is nice, it's difficult to see a scenario where the stock is fairly valued at current prices."

Daniel Jones,2023-04-01T07:42:29-04:00,SMPL,"The Simply Good Foods Company continues to grow but this doesn't make the company an ideal prospect. Despite management having bullish expectations for the current fiscal year, analysts have a mixed review that's at risk of missing the mark. Add on top of this uncertainty the fact that shares look pricey, and there are better opportunities for investors to consider at this time."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-31T10:25:18-04:00,GVA,"Construction spending in the US continues to rise, particularly amongst private industries. Although the firm has had a rocky operating history, recent performance by Granite Construction has been positive. Shares are also cheap and leading indicators for the company are encouraging."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-31T07:30:00-04:00,LW,"The management team at Lamb Weston Holdings is due to report financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year in a few days. Analysts have high expectations, but these might not be unrealistic given current market conditions and how the company has fared as of late. In all, the company still seems to offer a decent upside for investors moving forward."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-30T13:47:57-04:00,RRGB,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers has done incredibly well over the past couple of months, with shares nearly doubling. This is in spite of mixed but mostly weak financial results reported last month and was driven by strong guidance for the future. Uncertainty and risks both exist, but shares are still cheap enough to warrant upside from here."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-30T12:31:48-04:00,KBH,"KB Home has had a great few years, but leading indicators imply that weakness lies ahead. A plunge in backlog, caused by weak orders and a surge in the firm's cancellation rate, points to a decline in revenue, profits, and cash flows this year and beyond. Despite this pain, shares of the business are cheap and likely warrant some upside."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-30T05:57:16-04:00,MPW,"Medical Properties Trust announced that it struck a deal to sell off its assets in Australia, enabling it to pay off a large amount of debt. Cash flow is likely to fall in response to this, but the transaction should have a net positive impact on leverage. This further de-risks the business and justifies some rather attractive upside moving forward."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-29T09:17:32-04:00,BARK,"BARK, Inc. operates in a large and growing market that should continue to fare well in the long run. The firm's revenue has also skyrocketed in recent years, but growth is slowing and bottom line results are bad. The company is not the greatest prospect in this market, and investors might be better off looking elsewhere for opportunities."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-29T08:14:00-04:00,BOH,"Bank of Hawaii has, like so many other banks in recent weeks, been hit hard by fears over collapse. Fortunately for investors, the company is far more stable than those that have declined, and recent deposit data indicates as much. More clarity should be provided by management, but the picture as a whole for the business looks appealing."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-28T17:41:18-04:00,BABA,The management team at Alibaba Group announced that they were restructuring the company in a drastic shift away from a centralized model. This move should allow each unit today to focus on optimizing shareholder returns in a way that wasn't possible until now. The strategy should prove accretive to shareholder value and will likely benefit the company from a regulatory perspective as well.
Daniel Jones,2023-03-28T16:11:06-04:00,ULH,"Universal Logistics Holdings continues to fare well, especially on its bottom line, even though recent top line figures have been mixed. Despite some weakness the company has shown, it should see an improvement in key areas later this year. Add in how cheap shares are, and this is definitely a prospect that warrants some consideration from investors."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-28T12:36:04-04:00,BGRY,"Shares of Berkshire Grey roared higher, closing up after news broke that the company had agreed to sell itself to SoftBank Group. The all-cash transaction may make a lot of investors in the business unhappy, but it's a wise move in my view. Despite a history of strong sales growth and a sizable market opportunity, Berkshire Grey has a history of profit and cash flow issues."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-28T08:24:08-04:00,FCNCA,"The management team at First Citizens BancShares agreed to absorb Silicon Valley Bridge Bank in a deal that will drastically increase the company's asset base. This move grants First Citizens significant benefits and protections while building out and growing new and existing operations, respectively. Add on top of this the firm's already-robust financial condition, and it's a solid prospect for investors to consider."

Daniel Jones,2023-03-27T06:56:49-04:00,CWST,"Casella Waste Systems continues to post attractive sales, profit, and cash flow growth but has failed to keep up with the broader market. This is in spite of the fact that it has solid growth prospects moving forward thanks to capacity issues in the regions in which it operates. The long-term picture for the company is positive, but shares aren't yet cheap enough to be bullish over."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-26T11:43:46-04:00,AMH,"American Homes 4 Rent has demonstrated itself to be a great firm with an amazing ability to grow over time. On top of this, the firm has a nice growth catalyst that should translate to greater returns for investors moving forward. But shares, while cheaper than in the past, are not yet low enough to justify attractive upside for investors."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-26T08:04:20-04:00,PACW,"PacWest Bancorp has not been immune to the carnage seen in the banking industry, and understandably so. The management team at the company has provided a good deal of transparency and clarity into the firm's financial condition. Overall, the company looks to be stabilizing and its cash position is robust enough to warrant optimism."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-26T05:57:03-04:00,PAYX,"The management team at Paychex is expected to announce financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year on March 29th. Revenue growth is likely to slow, but I believe there's a decent chance of an earnings beat. The firm is a quality operator, but shares are not cheap enough to warrant attractive upside."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-24T17:01:08-04:00,MPW,"Medical Properties Trust has struggled in the market in recent months, with fears about the company's prospects moving forward. This comes even as the firm has worked to improve its financial position and as shares have gotten materially cheaper. Investors likely also fear a distribution cut, but this may very well not be needed. All in all, the company offers investors significant upside potential from here."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-24T08:26:17-04:00,LEVI,"Levi Strauss & Co. has failed to live up to my previous bullish stance on the firm, largely because of temporary weakness on its top and bottom lines. This is disappointing, but shares look attractively priced right now, and investors need to pay attention to the long run. Management has mixed expectations for 2023, but they continue to focus on growing the company at a nice clip over the next few years."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-24T06:00:00-04:00,NFLX,"Shares of Netflix saw a nice move higher, driven by general optimism in the tech space and by the prospect that the firm is seeing growing subscriber numbers in Canada. While this is nice, it's important to keep in mind that the company continues to grow nonetheless, but its real growth is occurring outside of the US and Canada. The firm is fine, but NFLX shares are pricey and there are better prospects that can be had at this time."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-23T21:49:48-04:00,WGO,"Winnebago has been negatively impacted by a great deal of pain in the industry in which it operates. This pain is likely to ease as the year progresses, but the overall picture for the firm should worsen relative to what it was last year. Even with this pain taking place, shares of the business look attractively-priced and likely offer investors at least some upside."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-23T08:30:00-04:00,OIL,"Oil prices took a hit over the past few days, driven by concerns over the health of the economy. Prices have started to recover, but investors need to pay attention to the bigger picture. There are mixed signals in the space right now, but a full assessment of the space indicates that a bullish outlook is more likely the accurate approach to take now."

The good news is that the Federal Reserve is forecasting only one additional hike for this year, but their language has been somewhat ambiguous. Further increases should be met with caution since the financial system seems to be more fragile than the Federal Reserve would like you to believe."

Daniel Jones,2023-03-22T10:51:54-04:00,DAKT,"Daktronics continues to post strong sales, profit, and cash flow results, and backlog is up year-over-year. DAKT stock looks affordable on an absolute basis and it's cheap relative to other firms. The business also has attractive growth potential from here that management can capitalize on and it has the footprint necessary to pursue it."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-22T09:53:57-04:00,GME,"GameStop posted what can only be called a really solid quarter at a time when sentiments regarding the business were incredibly negative. Cost-cutting initiatives are working and the firm is benefiting from strong industry demand on the hardware side. Its collectibles business continues to expand and management hopes to make further improvements this year. The prospects of the company in the long run are still bleak, but the firm has definitely leveled up from here."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-21T13:00:34-04:00,MUSA,"Murphy USA has done really well over the past year from a revenue, profit, and cash flow perspective. 2023 is supposed to be a time of some weakness, but this doesn't mean the company's not worth considering. Given how shares are priced and management's growth plans, I do believe the company offers upside potential from here."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-21T11:40:31-04:00,LANC,"Lancaster Colony Corporation has had a great run, with sales, profits, and cash flows all rising higher and pushing the stock up. While it's great to see quality performance rewarded, it's unclear how long market conditions will prove bullish for the firm. And irrespective of market data, shares are looking quite pricey at this point in time, perhaps pushing the company to the point where it deserves a downgrade."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-21T08:24:31-04:00,NYCB,The management team at New York Community Bancorp announced the purchase of a significant amount of assets from failed Signature Bank. This is a massive move that should add significant value to New York Community Bancorp and improve the company's own balance sheet. The firm was already attractive thanks to robust returns in recent years and a strong distribution.

Daniel Jones,2023-03-20T18:01:10-04:00,GFF,"Griffon Corporation has done quite well recently from a sales, profit, and cash flow perspective. The company looks solid, and management expects growth to continue this year. Shares look cheap at this point in time, and it's likely that the business won't experience material weakness until after 2023."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-20T07:05:45-04:00,AMT,"American Tower is a large-multinational REIT with a focus on telecommunications. The company's presence in Europe has grown remarkably in recent years, spurred on by a major acquisition. The economics of the region, combined with favorable demographic data, offers the company with attractive opportunities in the long run."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-20T04:21:06-04:00,VORBQ,The management team at Virgin Orbit Holdings announced plans to immediately stop operations for a week in order to preserve their capital. The most recent data made available by the firm suggests that cash is certainly in short supply. Current economic conditions have impacted the firm's ability to raise cash and there could be additional pain for investors right ahead.
Daniel Jones,2023-03-19T11:30:56-04:00,OLLI,"Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings is expected to announce financial results for the final quarter of its 2022 fiscal year. After a solid third quarter last year that demonstrated significant bottom line improvements, the firm is expected to repeat that kind of improvement this time around. If this trend continues, which is something guidance will go a long way toward demonstrating, then the firm will definitely warrant a bit more optimism from investors."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-19T08:56:31-04:00,FRCB,"First Republic Bank has declined enough that the stock is looking quite attractive. Despite this, and even though management has provided investors with multiple updates, there is too much opacity and uncertainty to make this a reasonable risk-to-reward prospect. This is especially true when you factor in certain fundamental components of the company like its loan portfolio."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-19T02:42:00-04:00,META,"Meta Platforms is now expanding to the US after initially launching in New Zealand and Australia. The service is pricey, but there's a large population of content creators that the firm hopes to benefit from. This strengthens the bullish case for the company, but there is some uncertainty to be aware of."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-18T01:15:46-04:00,WDFC,"WD-40 Company has faced a bit of pain lately, with sales, profits, and cash flows pulling back some. Despite this, management remains optimistic for 2023 as a whole, and the company offers attractive growth potential overseas. The business is a quality operator, but the stock is not cheap enough to make me bullish on it."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-16T09:53:08-04:00,SPX,"Interest rates have risen quite a bit over the past year, and the Federal Reserve looks set to continue that trend to combat inflation. Already, however, we are seeing significant signs that inflation is dying down, with some of the decline not having anything to do with interest rates.

Profits and cash flows have also weakened, but management remains optimistic that performance this year won't be all that bad. Even with the expectation of deterioration, shares look incredibly cheap, both on an absolute basis and relative to similar firms."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-15T17:13:52-04:00,STAG,"STAG Industrial has a great track record of growth, with sales, profits, and cash flows climbing nicely over the years. This has been driven by significant investments in new properties, plus the firm has succeeded in paying out distributions at the same time. The firm is a quality operator that's trading at a discount to many of its peers."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-15T11:29:21-04:00,SCHW,"The Charles Schwab Corporation has taken a beating in recent days thanks to concerns over a potential run on the organization. Shares have already recovered some, but further upside is warranted when you consider that the firm is far different from the banks that have failed. All things considered, this represents a great buying opportunity since the market clearly overreacted."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-14T12:17:51-04:00,T,"AT&T Inc. may not seem like much of a growth prospect when you first look at its numbers, but the numbers can be deceptive. Digging deeper, you see that there are parts of the company that are growing at a nice clip for a firm this size and in a market this mature. As older operations shrink, this should become more apparent and investors are likely to benefit."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-14T08:18:42-04:00,FRCB,"First Republic Bank took a beating recently, as concerns mount over its ability to remain in stable condition. This follows real pain that should have been seen from a mile away that has impacted similar financial institutions. Risk absolutely exists here, but upside potential could also be on the table for investors who don't mind that risk."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-13T10:45:44-04:00,DJI,"Markets have been volatile, initially starting 2023 bullishly before tumbling in response to recent Federal Reserve movements and statements.

The firm's balance sheet is solid, and management has demonstrated time and again that the business is a high-quality operator. But shares are pricey and likely have limited upside, if any, at this point in time."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-12T06:13:26-04:00,JJSF,"J&J Snack Foods has moved lower recently, in spite of sales climbing and because of a worsening on its bottom line. The space the company operates in is large and growing, but this and the lower share price don't make it a good prospect. Given how pricey the shares are, the firm may have additional downside before it's worth considering."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-10T04:36:24-05:00,APOG,"Apogee Enterprises continues to post attractive sales, profit, and cash flow growth. It's unclear what the picture holds for the business, but the overall picture looks positive for shareholders at the moment.

Daniel Jones,2023-03-10T04:07:20-05:00,HNI,"HNI Corporation has not had a great year or so, with shares of the business falling slightly more than the broader market has. This may signal to some investors that fundamentals are deteriorating, but that's not exactly the case. For the most part, HNI stock looks to be in decent shape, and shares look cheap."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-09T20:32:59-05:00,GE,"The management team at General Electric provided investors with a detailed update regarding the company's health and expectations moving forward. The future looks bright, particularly when it comes to the firm's GE Aerospace unit, with plenty of fuel to push sales, profits, and cash flows higher. All things considered, investors should view these developments in a very positive light."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-09T09:24:17-05:00,NPK,"National Presto Industries had something of a mixed year in 2022, with sales ultimately falling, but the second half of the year showing some bright spots. The firm's balance sheet is robust, and the long-term outlook for the business will likely be positive. But given how shares are priced, there are better prospects that can be had on the market today."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-09T08:22:47-05:00,PDCO,"Patterson Companies has had a rather mixed operating history in recent years, with sales climbing, but profits and cash flows posting volatile results. That trend has continued into the 2023 fiscal year, though cash flow data is looking up. The firm may not be the greatest prospect on the market, but it does seem to offer some upside based on how shares are priced today."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-08T20:36:42-05:00,HEES,"H&E Equipment Services has done incredibly well at growing both its top and bottom lines in recent quarters. Acquisitions and strong demand have been the key drivers here, and shares have done well in response. Add on how cheap shares are, and I believe that further upside is warranted from here."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-08T13:02:24-05:00,BWXT,"BWX Technologies has done well from a sales perspective, but bottom line results have been under pressure. Even with this being the case, guidance for 2023 is encouraging, but this doesn't make the company a great prospect. Shares have done well, but upside is limited from here based on how shares are priced today."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-08T05:58:06-05:00,TDUP,"ThredUp announced financial results covering the fourth quarter of the company's 2022 fiscal year that exceeded expectations. This, combined with strong guidance for 2023, sent TDUP shares roaring higher after months of declines. This is great to see and the company is doing better than in the past, but it's not exactly a great prospect right now."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-08T05:11:23-05:00,TNC,"Tennant Company posted some strong sales, profit, and cash flow results recently. The firm expects continued growth through 2023, which should make shares a bit cheaper. TNC stock looks fairly valued compared to similar firms, but it's cheap enough on an absolute basis to warrant further upside."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-07T17:35:36-05:00,VPG,"Vishay Precision Group has done well over the past couple of years, with sales, profits, and cash flows finally rising after years of mixed results. The near-term outlook for the company also looks positive based on sales expectations for the first quarter of this year. Shares are also on the cheap side of the spectrum and, as a result, likely have some upside potential."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-07T11:15:27-05:00,SUP,"Superior Industries International has seen a meteoric rise in recent months, with multiple contributors to its upside. Fundamentally, the company looks to be doing quite well and management seems to expect that to continue. Add on top of this how cheap shares are and the prospect of a buyout, and upside still exists moving forward."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-07T05:21:34-05:00,HOV,"At first glance, Hovnanian Enterprises looks like a dirt-cheap business that has tremendous upside potential. In the long run, the company might very well be fine, but it has a large amount of debt and is seeing signs of additional pain around the corner. Investors would be wise to approach this prospect with caution until we see the depths of this downturn."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-06T20:00:11-05:00,RBC,"RBC Bearings continues to show strong growth, both because of its major acquisition and due to organic strength. Long term, the company should fare well for its investors, but RBC stock isn't necessarily a great prospect. As things stand, it's a neutral play in my book because of how shares are priced."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-06T07:51:51-05:00,GIC,"The past several months have not been kind to Global Industrial Company and its investors, with shares tanking compared to the market. This seems to be due to pain on the firm's top and bottom lines in the second half of the year, and because of general concerns about the economy. Despite the pain, pain that is likely to continue near term, shares are looking attractive and probably do have some upside from here."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-06T05:41:49-05:00,DORM,"Dorman Products has had something of a lumpy operating history, but sales have done incredibly well in recent years. Current guidance is very bullish and could lead to some upside, but it's still too early to know if the company can deliver on it. At present, DORM shares look to be more or less fairly valued and likely have less upside as a result."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-05T12:48:39-05:00,WOOF,Petco Health and Wellness Company has not fared all that well compared to the broader market.

Daniel Jones,2023-03-05T06:35:28-05:00,MPX,"Marine Products Corporation has had a great run over the past several months, with shares rising nicely due to robust financial performance.

Daniel Jones,2023-03-04T09:34:46-05:00,GOLF,"The management team at Acushnet Holdings continues to post strong financial results for the company, both on its top and bottom lines. The future for the business also looks bright, with sales, profits, and cash flow likely to rise this year. Shares are also priced low enough to warrant additional upside from here despite rising so much already."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-03T15:47:25-05:00,MLKN,"MillerKnoll has not been treated kindly by the market as of late, with shares falling due to concerns about the future. Near term, the company may see some weakness, but recent financial performance has been solid and shares are cheap. Ultimately, this makes the firm a good prospect for value-oriented investors to consider."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-03T05:58:20-05:00,LMNR,"Limoneira Company's fundamental picture is showing signs of improvement, with top line and bottom line results getting better. The firm is also working to pay down debt through asset sales and transitioning toward an asset-light business model. While LMNR stock is far from being a great prospect, it is better than it was only in the middle of last year."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-02T20:46:34-05:00,CVEO,"Civeo Corporation took a beating after announcing mixed financial results and forecasting a weak 2023 fiscal year. It's not surprising that shares of the firm would fall in response to this, but the market isn't valuing the company appropriately. Shares offer additional upside from here so long as operations don't worsen materially moving forward."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-02T17:37:50-05:00,BOOT,"Boot Barn Holdings has had a great couple of months, with rising sales pushing shares higher. The firm has faced continued pressure on its bottom line, but the overall picture for the firm is still appealing. Add in that shares are still attractively priced, and it's likely that the firm can still move higher from here."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-02T12:00:00-05:00,ATRI,"Atrion Corporation has done well from a sales perspective very recently, but its overall financial performance in recent years has been disappointing. This is especially true of bottom line results that have shown no real growth. The firm is a stable operator that should be fine in the long run, but the stock is pricey for a company with limited growth."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-02T10:21:11-05:00,DKS,"DICK'S Sporting Goods has had some mixed results as of late, though an increase in guidance sent shares of the business higher. Fundamentally speaking, the business looks solid, though we could see some weakness at some point due to continued economic uncertainty. Given how cheap shares are, though, it seems as though the company has additional upside to offer investors right now."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-02T10:20:15-05:00,SFIX,"The management team at Stitch Fix is expected to report financial results covering the second quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year soon. Heading into earnings, analysts seem quite bearish, but so does management. Investors need to pay attention not only to headline news but also to the firm's deteriorating cash position. A cautious approach to the company during this time may not be a bad idea, though it may offer a nice upside if signs of a turnaround emerge."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-01T17:19:10-05:00,ONEW,"OneWater Marine continues to grow sales nicely, though the firm has shown some weakness and indicated that some future weakness lies ahead.

Daniel Jones,2023-03-01T15:22:46-05:00,PTSI,"P.A.M. Transportation Services is far from a great company, but continued growth has been encouraging. Unfortunately, the business is seeing some weakness across the board, and that is likely to continue. But given how cheap shares are, overall optimism is warranted at this time."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-01T08:58:53-05:00,LIND,"Lindblad Expeditions Holdings does continue to recover, but the bottom line results remain under pressure. It doesn't help that Lindblad has a great deal of debt on hand, but it is also true that the business is growing at a nice clip. All things considered, LIND stock could offer upside, but investors should approach the business with caution."
Daniel Jones,2023-03-01T07:00:47-05:00,KTB,"Kontoor Brands had a great run higher after management announced financial results covering the final quarter of the company's 2022 fiscal year. Sales and profits both exceeded expectations and management provided positive guidance for 2023. Though the easy money has been made, KTB shares still look attractively priced right now."
Daniel Jones,2023-02-28T16:00:34-05:00,SCI,"After a couple of great years caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Service Corporation International is seeing its financial performance pull back some. This may be disappointing to some investors, but the company remains a quality enterprise and its long-term picture should be positive. Shares aren't the cheapest, but they do likely offer some upside from here."
Daniel Jones,2023-02-28T09:57:57-05:00,NTGR,"The past few quarters have not been particularly great for Netgear, Inc. and its shareholders, with sales, profits, and cash flows falling. The 2022 fiscal year was quite bad for the business, but one part of Netgear does continue to grow at a nice clip. Long term, the picture for Netgear, Inc. is likely to be fine and the firm has plenty of cash on hand to survive this downturn."
Daniel Jones,2023-02-28T07:58:58-05:00,LAZY,"Lazydays Holdings has seen a significant decline in sales as of late, with market demand for RVs plummeting after years of strength. The firm also seems to have excess supply on hand, which could create additional pain moving forward. Add on top of this its hefty debt load, and it wouldn't necessarily be a bad idea for investors to turn cautious on the firm."
Daniel Jones,2023-02-27T16:44:08-05:00,GGG,"Graco has had a nice spurt of growth in the past couple of years, with sales, profits, and cash flows climbing higher. The firm's balance sheet also looks solid and its long-term picture is promising. But shares are a bit too lofty to warrant a significant amount of enthusiasm."
Daniel Jones,2023-02-27T12:11:18-05:00,MPW,"Medical Properties Trust was hit hard the other day due to reduced expectations regarding the 2023 fiscal year. Though disappointing, this does nothing to change the fact that shares look very cheap right now. The firm may not be as attractive as I previously thought, but its low valuation and continued improvements justify upside moving forward."
Daniel Jones,2023-02-27T08:22:04-05:00,J,"Jacobs Solutions has done quite well for itself in recent years, with its transformation yielding positive results. Strong backlog should push sales, profits, and cash flows higher moving forward as well. Shares aren't the cheapest, but they do seem to have some upside potential to them."
Daniel Jones,2023-02-27T05:10:23-05:00,RENT,"Rent the Runway continues to post strong sales growth, thanks to a rise in the number of subscribers year-over-year. Bottom line results are also improving, but they are far away from where they need to be. For now, I believe there are better prospects to be had, but the firm could eventually grow into its valuation."
Daniel Jones,2023-02-26T08:31:40-05:00,MODG,"Topgolf Callaway Brands continues to grow nicely on both its top and bottom lines. That trend is set to continue and the market has responded positively to this. Shares still look attractively-undervalued, but they aren't as appealing as they were during my previous coverage though, in part due to recent upside."
Daniel Jones,2023-02-26T04:56:57-05:00,IBP,"Installed Building Products has had a great run in recent months, with shares roaring higher due to strong sales, profit, and cash flow growth. Shares look quite cheap right now and are fairly cheap compared to similar firms. Given changes in the space and because of the share price move higher, a more cautious approach to the business would not be unwise."
Daniel Jones,2023-02-26T04:27:11-05:00,CVGI,"Commercial Vehicle Group has a history of mixed but generally positive financial results. Recently, bottom line results have come under pressure, but this is normal for the company. Shares look cheap enough on an absolute basis to likely have some upside potential associated with it."

Gen Alpha,2023-04-11T08:05:00-04:00,CVS,"CVS Health is trading in deep bargain territory at present, with the market valuing it at a no-growth level. The valuation is undeserved, as the company is executing well, and Oak Street should be value accretive in a couple of years.

The poor performance was attributed to another miserable performance relative to annual guidance with FY2022 production of ~81,000 ounces at costs of $1,483/oz, a significant miss. Unfortunately, 2023 isn’t expected to be a much better year based on guidance, and costs could miss yet again with the strengthening of the Brazilian Real. So, while Jaguar remains reasonably valued and is one miner that hasn’t participated in the sector-wide rally to date, I still see far more attractive opportunities elsewhere."

This underperformance is not surprising given that Mt. Todd is not any closer to heading into production, even if the team is engaging with potential interested parties. Unfortunately, given inflationary pressures experienced sector-wide and capex blowouts witnessed at many greenfield/brownfield sites, I continue to believe the 2021 TR isn't conservative enough. So, while Vista is undoubtedly cheap on a P/NPV basis, I don't see any catalysts for a re-rating, which favors owning other developers or producers benefiting from gold prices vs. Vista in the current environment."

However, this was partially overshadowed by worse-than-expected inflationary pressures which resulted in several capex blowouts, suggesting that the 2021 TR capital cost assumptions may not be conservative enough. In fact, and as noted previously, the 2021 TR used Q1-20 pricing & I see an extremely low likelihood of delivering this project at a cost of just $7.4 billion. While higher gold prices will lift all boats, NovaGold is not a beneficiary today (like producers or near-term producers) and upfront costs and a higher cost of capital are negatives, so I continue to see far more attractive ways to play the sector."

Although AU's 2022 results were satisfactory, and it was one of few miners to deliver on guidance, 2023 will be a high-cost year and this is a gradual turnaround.

The company had a busy year where it invested the most since 2015 and its portfolio is better for it, with increased diversification and higher exposure to Tier-1 jurisdictions.

While the company is quick to point out the valuation discrepancy relative to peers, I continue to see USAS as cheap for a reason. With steady share dilution, one of the worst production growth per share trends in the sector, and an inability to deliver on promises, I see the stock as an Avoid at US$0.50."

Unfortunately, the maiden resource at Great Bear came in well below my estimates and likely below most investors' expectations, reinforcing the view that it overpaid for GBR. Meanwhile, the level of reserve replacement was disappointing at existing assets as well, especially considering the 17% hike in the gold price assumption ($1,400/oz vs. $1,200/oz) to inform reserves. While KGC remains reasonably valued after 2 years of underperformance, I continue to see more attractive opportunities elsewhere, especially following the underwhelming Great Bear update."

Taylor Dart,2023-03-02T17:42:58-05:00,GFI,"Gold Fields is one of the worst-performing gold producers this year, down 11% year-to-date, which I attribute to a weaker 2023 outlook than some might have hoped for. Aside from group AISC that are expected to increase ~20% year-over-year (2023 vs. 2022), Salares Norte is behind schedule and won't pour gold until Q4 2023, representing a six-month delay. The good news is that 2024 should be a much better year with partial commercial production from its monster Tier-1 scale asset, Salares Norte, helping to claw back lost margins. However, with Gold Fields still not offering a meaningful margin of safety and up against tough comps because of last year's outperformance vs. peers, I see better opportunities elsewhere for now."

The report saw another increase to upfront capex (3%), a significant miss on FY2022 cost guidance, an underwhelming 2023 outlook, and a large impairment. Although its current operating assets take a backseat to Magino, the weaker outlook will weigh on FY2023 cash flow, and I've had to revise fair value down given the outlook. At a current share price of US$0.33, Argonaut remains very reasonably valued, but I don't see the reward/risk ratio as favorable enough just yet, so I exited my position for a ~36% gain following the news."

Unfortunately, the stock has underperformed the Gold Miners Index in the period, which I attribute to the stock being one of the most overbought names heading into February. However, Evolution had a solid fiscal Q2 report, H2 2023 is shaping up to be better, and it looks set to maintain its industry-leading margins with ongoing work at RL/Mungari. That said, while Evolution could easily put together an oversold bounce, I don't see the stock in a low-risk buy zone just yet, so I see patience as the best course of action for investors."

This is entirely justified and the outperformance should be even more significant than it has been because i-80 Gold has made two major new discoveries in Nevada. Based on its recent discoveries, I see the potential for the company to produce 250,000+ gold-equivalent ounces per annum medium term and 400,000+ ounces long term, with further upside from GCOP/Mineral Point. A production profile of this size (400,000 ounces) at industry-leading costs in a Tier-1 mining jurisdiction (Nevada) can easily command a market cap of $2.50+ billion, so I see meaningful long-term upside to this story and see the stock as a steal below US$2.40."

The solid Q4 performance helped cap off a solid year for the company and while it saw cost inflation that weighed on its margins, Hecla fared much better than its peers. I attribute this to Hecla operating low-volume, high-grade mines with by-product credits, though its relatively high-grade Casa Berardi Mine had a tough year and 2023 won't be any better. After a ~25% decline, Hecla is no longer overvalued and a short-term bounce is possible, but I don't see any margin of safety in place just yet, suggesting patience is the best course of action."

Credit quality in the CRE portfolio is likely to be a key watch item given M&T's above-average exposure, and particularly so in the office portfolio. Growth drivers are harder to come by, as loan growth is likely to soften further and operating costs could head higher on higher compliance costs. M&T looks undervalued on a long-term basis, but investors will need reassurance that the deposit/liquidity situation is well in hand and there are no negative surprises on credit."

Constellation's key brands continue to outperform the larger beer category, and with expanding distribution and product offerings, I believe the company will continue to see market share growth. Constellation looks undervalued on a longer-term basis, but investors should be alert to the risk of near-term volatility on depletion and margin guidance."

First Republic is in relatively better shape, including a higher ratio of tangible equity to unrealized losses and more diverse deposits and funding. Higher funding costs are almost certain and First Republic would do well to pull back on lending and rebuild a liquidity cushion, but that will impact earnings. I believe FRC is an earnings story more than a survival story, but the bank is not out of the woods if another wave of panic hits the market."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-14T10:27:27-04:00,PACW,"PacWest has come under severe pressure, as the market fears a run on deposits similar to SVB and an un-survivable squeeze on liquidity. Tech companies make up a significant percentage of PacWest's deposits, but the U.S. government has thus far backstopped both insured and uninsured depositors. Unrealized mark-to-market losses are a meaningful percentage of tangible common equity, but a new funding facility should eliminate the need to sell securities to raise funds. Management was already slowing loan growth and reprioritizing around its core community bank lending operations. I believe PacWest survives this liquidity squeeze, but there will still be consequences from lower loan growth, higher funding costs, and increasing credit losses."

With auto MCUs still in short supply and Renesas leveraging business wins in areas like ADAS, the near-term outlook is healthy in auto. The near-term outlook in Industrial, Infrastructure, and IoT is less robust, but longer-term leverage to automation, electrification, IoT, and renewables remains attractive. Even after a big run, the shares look undervalued compared to many peers and rivals in the MCU space."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-10T12:03:17-05:00,HURC,"Hurco's fiscal first quarter results met my expectations, but did show clear weakness in North American and European sales that was significantly worse than typical industrial reports for the quarter. Uncertainty is the word of the day now, with many companies guiding to weaker demand in the second half of 2023 and warning of below-average visibility on customer demand. Hurco has been a ""first in, first out"" company in the past and results could be a sign of worse things to come for the broader group. I expect orders and revenue to turn around sooner here than for the larger group, and Hurco has good leverage to further growth in reshoring/near-shoring of manufacturing. Hurco shares offer a double-digit return from here, but this is an unfollowed, less-liquid manufacturing company that is far off most investors' radar."

Fourth quarter pharmaceutical sales were fine, and Roche has a strong roster of $1B-plus/year drugs, but growth may be limited to around 3% to 4% over time. I expect mid-single-digit long-term FCF growth from Roche, and the company will continue to generate ample cash flow to fund R&D, M&A, and returns to shareholders. I continue to believe that Roche needs to fundamentally re-examine its approach to drug development, as pipeline productivity has been declining. Roche's underperformance leads to a more attractive valuation, but there is a real risk that the shares lag as a ""value trap"" without growth drivers that can excite the Street."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-08T09:32:33-05:00,CAT,"Caterpillar is a hotly-debated bellwether in the heavy machinery market, as bears believe most of the business is at or near the top of the cycle. Light construction does indeed look ""toppy"" to me, but I think underlying strength in heavy construction (infrastructure), mining, and oil/gas could prove stronger for longer. Caterpillar has traded at 20x to 25x trough EPS in the past. If a 20x to 25x P/E multiple is still valid, 20x the lowest EPS estimate on the board right now ($13.50 in FY'24) supports a fair value of $270."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-08T04:11:40-05:00,ITW,"Illinois Tool Works has continued to execute well on margins, but growth looks more limited given a lack of leverage to attractive long-term growth markets. Translating margin improvements into free cash flow hasn't been a consistent process, though I do expect progress toward 20% FCF margins over the next five years. Companies have gotten more cautious on auto volume predictions, and ITW has exposure to weakening construction and short-cycle industrial markets. Mid-single-digit FCF growth isn't enough to support an attractive return from here, and the shares already trade with a meaningful embedded quality premium."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-07T18:03:43-05:00,IFNNY,"Infineon's fiscal first quarter was a bit light on revenue, but better on margins, and guidance for the next quarter was strong relative to many chip companies. Auto demand looks healthy for 2023, as auto microcontrollers are sold out and demand for EV powertrain and ADAS chips is strong. Weakness in consumer markets is a known issue now, but emerging weakness in industrial markets (drives in particular) is something to watch. Infineon looks like a classic ""short-term versus long-term"" debate, with elevated risk in the short term from pricing, weaker orders, and so on, but a strong long-term outlook. Long-term revenue and FCF growth in the high-single-digit to low-double-digits can support a fair value roughly 20% higher than today's price."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-07T18:02:17-05:00,LOMA,"Loma Negra's fourth quarter results should show still-healthy volumes, effective pricing actions, and EBITDA/ton in the low-$30s, but the weak macro environment in Argentina is going to weigh on 2023. Management has effectively leveraged improved volumes and pricing to drive better margins, as well as plant modernization and cost/logistics optimization. Further margin improvement is likely more dependent upon capex (plant modernization) and a better macro environment, including lower energy prices. The fate of Loma Negra's rail concession is still somewhat in doubt, particularly with respect to how efficiently the rail lines will operate after the concession ends. Loma Negra could be significantly undervalued if Argentina's economy improves, but that's a risky bet and it's tough for a good company to win out over a weak macro."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-07T12:00:00-05:00,ING,"ING Groep's fourth quarter results were a little light on loan growth, but otherwise beat across the board, with a 25% pre-tax income beat driven by healthier spreads and provisions. I don't expect much loan demand growth from mortgage or corporate customers, so rate sensitivity will have to drive the bus from here; I expect double-digit NII growth in FY'23. Flush with capital, I expect another significant buyback announcement, but management may want to consider using some capital to acquire growing non-spread-dependent businesses (like payments). Core long-term growth of around 3%, including around 20% growth from FY'22-FY'25, can drive a fair value for the ADRs around $17.50, but a muted long-term growth outlook is a risk to sentiment."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-07T10:30:00-05:00,ABBNY,"ABB's fourth quarter results were mixed relative to expectations, with good revenue growth but some ongoing challenges in margins and free cash flow. Short-cycle exposure could hit ABB a little harder than some of its peers, particularly with a greater exposure to capex machinery versus subscription-based software. ABB offers good long-term exposure to automation and electrification, but there is work to do to optimize the portfolio, with an eye toward maximizing the revenue, margin, and FCF opportunities. A fair value in the mid-$30's doesn't offer abundant upside at today's price, and while the long-term growth opportunities are attractive, there are higher near-term macro risks."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-07T09:02:15-05:00,GRBMF,"Grupo Bimbo has been executing well across its operations, including improved product development, manufacturing, and distribution efficiency.

Stephen Simpson,2023-03-06T16:24:00-05:00,ABCB,"Ameris came up short on the topline in the fourth quarter, as a more fixed-rate loan book compared to many peers caps the near-term benefit of higher rates. Management has meaningfully diversified the loan book while also significantly upgrading the deposit base; modest asset sensitivity should be a positive from here, and I expect better-than-average deposit costs. Long-term core earnings growth around 6% can support a fair value around $50, while shorter-term multiples-based approaches support a $54 fair value."

Between the RECON results and a recent meta-analysis of past studies, the clinical argument for using AxoGen's products (good efficacy, patient outcomes, and costs) continues to strengthen. AxoGen shares look undervalued relative to what the market often pays for mid-teens revenue growth, but the company must step up account volumes and revenue growth to see a rerating."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-05T02:23:39-05:00,LXRX,"Lexicon is getting closer to FDA approval for sotagliflozin, and the ongoing labeling discussions with the agency may prove critical in differentiating the drug from established rivals. Sotagliflozin may be superior in terms of reducing hospitalizations and cardiac events, but a lack of direct head-to-head studies could be an issue for more expansive labeling. Despite equivocal results in Phase II testing, management is planning a pivotal clinical trial program for LX9211 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. LX9211 does appear to produce pain relief, and with an attractive safety/risk profile, but it is unclear whether that relief will reach clinical significance in a well-designed pivotal study. I can argue for a fair value close to $6 on the basis of sotagliflozin and LX9211, but there are considerable challenges ahead."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-04T23:38:59-05:00,DAN,"Dana missed fourth quarter EBITDA expectations by a meaningful amount and lowered margin guidance as the company continues to see the impact of inflation and higher investments into EV capabilities. I continue to believe that Dana's investments into electrification are worthwhile, and the company boasts a growing backlog across light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and off-highway vehicles. It's going to take longer for Dana to get to my mid-single-digit FCF margin targets, but I still believe the shares are undervalued below the high teens."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-04T01:36:38-05:00,HOLI,"HollySys posted good second quarter results, with the company continuing to grow its automation business in the petrochemical and oil/gas markets and rail projects getting back on track. The Chinese government is pushing for enterprises in strategic sectors to opt for local providers when possible, and that should benefit HollySys at the expense of international automation rivals. Expansion of the rail network, on catching up on pandemic-delayed projects, remains a government priority, but HollySys has to prove it can drive more consistent results here. HollySys is not overvalued assuming mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-to-mid-teens FCF margins, but investability is an issue as investor communication and disclosure are suboptimal."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-03T18:08:23-05:00,PH,"Parker-Hannifin has continued to execute well, and the Street has become more confident in the company's long-term ability to generate above-market growth and margin leverage. Short-cycle markets still matter, though, and I expect to see weaker end-market demand as 2023 progresses. Parker-Hannifin offers an excellent track record and good growth, but the valuation largely reflects that."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-03T12:52:20-05:00,FHN,"First Horizon sparked a 10%-plus sell-off on news in its 10-K that Toronto-Dominion had informed them that they will not be able to complete the merger by the established deadline. Toronto-Dominion recently unveiled its $50B community investment plan, but it typically takes months after such plans to get approval, and further concessions may yet be required. Toronto-Dominion management sounded committed to the deal on its earnings call, and the deal is a meaningful one for the bank, but TD may push for some concessions. First Horizon has little bargaining power and would not be entitled to compensation if the deal collapses, and would in fact see dilution from preferred stock issued to TD. With a standalone fair value in the low-$20s, I think First Horizon investors will be OK if the deal collapses, but a negotiated extension is the better outcome."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-03T11:47:13-05:00,MRVL,"Marvell once again lowered guidance, with broad weakness across much of the business, including the lucrative data center storage end-market. Growth drivers like 800G/1.6T PAM-4 and custom ASIC for artificial intelligence may need a bit longer to ramp, while accelerating 5G product sales will undermine margins. The Street convinced itself that Marvell was a differentiated growth story with less cyclical risk, and unwinding that is likely to lead to overcorrection in revenue and margin estimates. I like the long-term growth opportunities at Marvell, but I need to see more free cash flow conversion and the valuation isn't good enough for me yet."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-03T01:05:40-05:00,RRX,"Altra's fourth quarter results included a few curious items, as management's calculation of organic revenue may have understated underlying growth. The Automation and Specialty business appeared to have posted healthy double-digit growth on solid underlying automation demand, while Power Transmission Technologies looked a bit soft relative to peers/rivals. Results came in at the low end of management's earlier guidance, but margins still compare well to other industrial power/motion companies. Regal Rexnord is getting a high-quality business that should create meaningful synergies in attractive markets like automation and precision motion. There's really not enough upside left in Altra shares to be worth whatever risk there is that the deal doesn't go through."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-02T17:42:36-05:00,FORM,"FormFactor's fourth quarter results surpassed lowered expectations, but included a steep 25% year-over-year decline in wafer probe card revenue and major hits to the company's profitability. Technoprobe outperformed in FormFactor, but weaker guidance relative to FormFactor for Q1'23 leads me to wonder about the balance between market share and product/customer mix between them. I do still see risk that the cyclical semiconductor downturn could last a bit longer, but FormFactor should be leveraged to recovering logic markets in 2H'23. FormFactor's valuation is so-so now (a fair value in the low-to-mid-$30s), but rerating and beat-and-raise quarters later in 2023 are plausible."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-02T15:24:22-05:00,AMSSY,"Despite lower expectations, ams-OSRAM has continued to disappoint, including recent large cuts to guidance for Q1'23 and an early cut to 2024 guidance. The company's leverage to Apple (vs Android) smartphones has helped, but weaker Apple volumes are a risk in 2023, as is the company's skew to lower-value slots. Auto build rates should be positive in 2023, but the European market will likely be relatively weak and ams-OSRAM hasn't made the hoped-for progress in more advanced sensing-driven auto products. The microLED opportunity remains a significant one, and if ams-OSRAM can build an edge in assembly, it could establish valuable cost leadership. A new CEO could be the right medicine for this long-ailing company, and the expectations are low, but it will take time to rebuild the growth story."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-02T14:44:21-05:00,BRFS,"BRF SA's fourth quarter results once again came in well short of Street profit expectations, but there was at least progress in the Brazilian operations. The Brazilian operations saw share gains in the processed food business and meaningful production/operating cost improvement. The international business is under pressure from weaker global poultry prices (oversupply) and a cost structure that is just too high to achieve sustainably attractive margins. Management seems to be on the right track with its improvement plans, and the share price is beaten down, but there are still significant operating and macro risks in play."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-02T02:46:33-05:00,USB,"U.S. Bancorp's Q4'22 results were uninspiring on a core basis, but some of that was due to a meaningful balance sheet repositioning that should drive improved growth and capital returns. With the Union Bank deal done and the company beyond a pivot point after years of IT investment, this bank should deliver significant operating leverage over the next three years. Provided that the economy cooperates, I see a chance of high-teens' annualized pre-provision growth over the next three years. Many peer banks offer similar levels of potential return, but I like the operating leverage skew at U.S. Bancorp as it is more driven by execution than external factors."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-01T22:13:51-05:00,KNX,"Knight-Swift had a disappointing fourth quarter, as deterioration in the core trucking and logistics markets hit the company even harder than expected. Trucking continues to be pressured by overcapacity and weak freight demand, and an expected second-half recovery is tied to improved consumer spending and further retailer destocking. Management once again endorsed its $4/share-plus trough earnings target, but the Street is increasingly skeptical. I do like the long-term story at Knight-Swift, including diversification/expansion into less-than-truckload, but there are definitely risks to the near-term market outlook."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-01T17:30:33-05:00,HTLD,"Heartland saw weaker operating earnings in the fourth quarter, with the business pressured by weaker freight demand, a weaker market for used equipment, and the inclusion of less-efficient acquired businesses. Trucking continues to correct, with spot rates down over 20% on weak freight demand and still-abundant capacity. Trucking demand should recover in the second half of 2023, but it may be too bullish to expect a big inventory-driven freight cycle. Heartland benefits from long-lasting relationships with large customers, but upside in 2023 will likely come more from cost synergies tied to the Smith and CFI deals. Heartland shares still look attractive below $18 as an early play on a trucking cycle recovery."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-01T16:48:23-05:00,SMMNY,"Hospital capital spending demand is strong, but Siemens Healthineers posted a small yet broad miss across its major business units for the fiscal first quarter. Imaging is performing well and Varian and Advanced Therapies were compromised by supply chain challenges, but core underperformance in Diagnostics is an ongoing issue. New launches in Imaging should drive attractive revenue growth, and Varian remains far and away the leader in radiation oncology, but Diagnostics needs more TLC. Siemens Healthineers shares look 15% to 25% undervalued today."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-01T15:15:26-05:00,ETN,"Eaton's fourth quarter results were largely in line with expectations, but included above-average revenue growth and good margin leverage. The Electrical business has a robust pipeline of business (backlog up nearly 100% in the Americas) on building retrofits, grid upgrades, and charging infrastructure growth. Eaton has excellent long-term leverage to automation, renewable power, and data traffic through its Electrical business, as well as leverage to aerospace and e-vehicle growth. The worst I can say about Eaton is that the valuation already factors in a lot of the good news, but the multi-year end-market outlook is among the best in the sector."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-01T10:46:16-05:00,DELL,"Weak PC shipments are a concern heading into Dell's fiscal Q4 report, but premiumization and lower component costs should help, but enterprise could be the bigger risk. Multiple sources are pointing to declining server and storage demand, threatening a weaker outlook for Dell over the next couple of quarters. Dell has leverage to edge cloud and AI spending on servers on storage, and opportunities in software, outsourcing, and IaaS, but has to prove it can achieve meaningful revenue growth. Dell looks undervalued on low single-digit growth assumptions, but low-growth tech value plays can take a long time to work."
Stephen Simpson,2023-03-01T02:21:56-05:00,ICUI,"ICU Medical spent far more time, energy, and resources than expected in 2022 on fixing Smiths Medical, but the heavy lifting seems largely done for most of the businesses. Allowing that current results don't reflect the full impact of the improvements management has made, underlying sequential performance in the core business was still lackluster in Q4. Results should continue to improve through 2023 as the 2022 fixes play out, but the ""new normal"" and real synergies aren't likely to emerge until 2024 and beyond. I can argue for a share price closer to $200, but the issues at Smith Medical have cost the company a year or so of leverage and improvement."
Stephen Simpson,2023-02-28T15:18:16-05:00,FCFS,"Core pawn operations were healthy in the fourth quarter, with double-digit growth in pawn receivables and mid-teens core pretax income growth. The lease-to-own operations are seeing steady credit trends, but weaker demand/volume and competition from a myriad of point-of-sale finance options could be playing a role. With access to stable and attractively-priced funding, FirstCash has an advantage over many fintech-based consumer finance rivals and should benefit through this more challenging phase of the cycle. Core long-term FCF growth in the high-single-digit, underpinned by steady results in the U.S. pawn business and ongoing expansion in Latin American pawn operations, can support a higher share price."
Stephen Simpson,2023-02-28T10:20:02-05:00,HON,"Honeywell's fourth quarter results were largely typical of the larger industrial sector and basically in-line with expectations, though with a modest segment-level earnings beat. Management guidance for FY'23 was perhaps more cautious than investors expected given its later-cycle leverage, but close to 40% of the business could arguably be called short-cycle. Aerospace should remain an area of strength, as should building automation, but warehouse automation, sensing, Productivity Solutions, and Advanced Materials could see some pressure in 2023. There will always be a lot of moving parts to the Honeywell story, but I expect 5% long-term revenue growth and 10% FCF growth, and the shares are back to a more reasonable valuation."
Stephen Simpson,2023-02-28T02:44:47-05:00,LECO,"Lincoln Electric's fourth quarter results were very healthy in absolute terms but a little short of expectations and guidance for FY'23 had some notes of caution. General fabrication, heavy industry, and construction/infrastructure are markets to watch for possible weakness, while auto, energy, and longer-cycle mining and ag should be solid. Lincoln has steadily built up its capabilities in automation and new welding technologies and I expect even more leverage from these businesses in the coming years. Mid-single-digit core growth doesn't really support a substantially higher share price now and this is a name to jump on if there's a more significant pullback."
Stephen Simpson,2023-02-28T00:10:56-05:00,ALNY,"Alnylam's fourth quarter results were consistent with recently updated guidance, while guidance for FY'23 was modestly weaker for product revenue and more significantly weaker for collaboration revenue. The FDA will conduct an advisory panel meeting for the company's application for Onpattro in ATTR-CM, and I expect pointed questions/commentary about the endpoints and the breadth of the label. ALN-APP results are coming, and not only is Alzheimer's disease significant, this is an important milestone in extending Alnylam's addressable markets beyond liver-mediated diseases. A 15% or so pullback puts ALNY shares in a more favorable risk/reward position."
Stephen Simpson,2023-02-27T16:19:08-05:00,FMX,"FEMSA's fourth quarter results were mixed, with healthy core traffic at OXXO, but some softness in retail margins and higher expenses for the digital businesses. Management completed their strategic review and announced a return to the company's core operations (retail, Coca-Cola FEMSA, and digital), with the Heineken stake and logistics/distribution operations to be sold. FEMSA's U.S. logistics/distribution operations were better than the Street gave credit for, but I believe refocusing on retail opportunities across the Americas is the better use of capital. FEMSA shares have done very well over the last six months or so but should still offer double-digit annualized return potential from here."
Stephen Simpson,2023-02-27T14:24:38-05:00,BAC,"Bank of America has lagged since earnings, with above-average rate sensitivity seen as a risk if the Fed turns more dovish. Bank of America has improved its business on many fronts and it would take a sharp drop in the Fed Funds rate (around 250bp-300bp) to justify today's valuation. While Bank of America isn't my favorite large bank, it's hard to reconcile the current valuation with the quality and likely trajectory of the bank's earnings."
Stephen Simpson,2023-02-26T05:56:11-05:00,CW,"Curtiss-Wright announced modestly better fourth quarter results, with improved supply chain performance helping the Defense Electronics business. CW offers attractive leverage to recovering commercial aerospace markets, healthy defense markets, and improving nuclear power markets, as well as growth in areas like agricultural equipment. Long-term revenue growth around 6% and low double-digit FCF growth can support an okay return from here, but Curtiss-Wright could still rerate on its relatively better end-market exposures."
Stephen Simpson,2023-02-26T01:18:35-05:00,BRC,"Brady produced fiscal second quarter results that included mid-single-digit revenue growth (which drove an EPS beat) and margin improvement. I believe leverage to healthcare, entertainment, and manufacturing is helping Brady outperform some of its peers while pruning inadequately profitable products is benefiting margins. Valuation looks more ""okay"" than ""compelling"", but Brady's self-help opportunities and market/product exposures could help drive a little outperformance as industrial output declines."
Nick Ackerman,2023-04-14T11:18:53-04:00,BME,"BME continues to trade flirting at or close to premiums but remains a solid holding nonetheless. If you lack some healthcare exposure, BME could be one way to gain further exposure. The fund's distribution rate might not be as compelling as some other CEFs, but it's also one of the most steady."
Nick Ackerman,2023-04-13T13:21:52-04:00,ECF,"In 2022, we highlighted how ECF was ""a clear choice"" over GCV. This has been playing out, and it could have more to go. However, with GCV's higher distribution yield, it could support its current valuation better."

Nick Ackerman,2023-04-12T13:05:09-04:00,MFD,"MFD enjoyed a relatively calm 2022 when most other asset classes saw sizeable drops. The utility exposure that helped it out last year has been a bit weaker this year, but the fund has still provided some gains. The fund's deep discount could make it an interesting fund for investors looking to add some utility and infrastructure."
Nick Ackerman,2023-04-10T11:45:58-04:00,SPE,"SPE regularly trades at a discount, but that discount has been widening significantly. The fund suffered in 2022, as did most equities and bonds, but held up relatively better than the market. With a larger weighting to CEFs, the fund also had to contend with widening discounts in those positions across the board."
Nick Ackerman,2023-04-10T07:59:22-04:00,CAT,"Despite an expected recession, CAT recently hit all-time highs before cooling off. A softer economy is not positive for this type of company, but a long-term shareholder probably has nothing to worry about. They've survived plenty of recessions, with their dividend intact, too, to become a dividend aristocrat."
Nick Ackerman,2023-04-10T04:20:00-04:00,EVG,"EVG has recently sunk to a larger discount making it relatively more attractive since our last update, but not at quite a ""Buy"" level yet. The fund's short-duration focus had helped it reduce moves lower in the last year, but only mildly. The fund pays a managed distribution based on 10% of its NAV, which resets monthly, but the latest distribution appears to have changed this policy."
Nick Ackerman,2023-04-08T02:58:38-04:00,GDV,"GDV is a fairly plain equity fund investing in value-oriented sectors. Its financial exposure is primarily tilted toward large banks and institutions; however, it also carries some exposure to regional banks. The fund continues to trade at a wide discount and carries a reasonable distribution yield that should be maintained in the current environment."
Nick Ackerman,2023-04-04T15:27:55-04:00,GHY,"GHY is a high yield bond fund with a global focus. The fund continues to remain at a deep and attractive discount. However, the fund's distribution coverage remains weak."
Nick Ackerman,2023-04-04T13:59:12-04:00,STAG,"STAG has been selling off more recently with the latest bout of market volatility. This has pushed it back down to a fairly attractive level after making a sharp recovery earlier this year. The dividend growth once again disappointed, but having more cash around during times of uncertainty isn't necessarily bad."
Nick Ackerman,2023-04-03T13:01:42-04:00,BTZ,"BTZ invests with a split between investment-grade and below-investment-grade debt with a multi-sector approach. The fund's latest discount has dropped into the double-digit area, where it becomes a more appealing investment option. A big drawback here is the fund's distribution coverage is severely lacking."
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-29T17:42:55-04:00,PAYX,"PAYX delivered another solid quarter of growth in both earnings and revenue. With a recession expected later this year, there could be some headwinds, but forecasts are still for solid growth. After earnings, we're getting a pop in the share price, but we still won't be overvalued after any move."
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-29T15:41:22-04:00,VICI,"VICI Properties Inc. has remained resilient in the last year but has been slipping along with the broader markets more recently. I've sold some puts, but even the current price would appear attractive to consider adding this name. They've continued to grow their dividend, and with AFFO expected to continue growing, it would be anticipated that more growth is in the future."
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-28T21:06:13-04:00,WDI,"WDI has raised its distribution two more times since our fall update. The fund's discount remains attractive. Risk-free ways to make money have become more competitive, but with those that can handle more volatility and risk, there are opportunities too."
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-27T21:53:52-04:00,XFLT,"XFLT is benefiting from higher interest rates, even if the share price doesn't seem to reflect this. Their latest quarterly report shows distribution coverage climbing to 119%. If the whole financial system doesn't crumble and we don't head into a deep recession at this pace, an increase at year-end could be necessary."

However, the positioning that they've chosen to take differs, and that's played a significant role in their past performance and should going forward as well. I hold positions in both, and I believe they can be good complementary investments when held simultaneously due to their differences."

With all the uncertainty, a wider discount could be appropriate as credit risks become a real issue. At the same time, we are now trading near all-time-wide discounts for this fund that had historically traded at premiums."
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-26T03:42:45-04:00,CII,CII performed relatively well through the last year despite all the volatility. Covered call writing contributed to a sizeable portion of the fund's distribution. The downside here is that investors seem to have noticed and pushed CII to a historically narrow discount.
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-25T05:11:21-04:00,MCN,MCN has been able to reduce losses relative to the market. This would be thanks to its call-writing strategy plus holding a significant portion of its portfolio in money markets. The defensive positioning of this fund has been quite simple but incredibly effective. Other investors have seemed to take notice as the fund continues to trade at a rich premium.
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-23T22:05:05-04:00,BOE,"BOE shares some similarities with BDJ but has a sizeable portion of its portfolio outside the U.S. The fund's performance in 2022 was helped out by call writing, but having some heavier weightings in tech seemed to hurt results. BOE is currently paying out an attractive distribution that seems sustainable at the current level."
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-22T21:06:02-04:00,SCD,"SCD is a fund I've provided coverage on quite regularly as it's a unique fund. The fund carries a portfolio of MLPs and tech as its largest weightings though it is somewhat diversified overall, too, after those weightings. The fund's distribution yield of 8.79% is quite attractive, but it will rely on capital gains to fund the payout."
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-21T12:15:46-04:00,BDJ,"BDJ has been a long-term position in my closed-end fund portfolio. The fund is attractive and delivers dependable monthly distributions. However, with only a slight discount, I'd be hesitant to consider adding even after financials took a big hit."

Nick Ackerman,2023-03-19T04:54:10-04:00,RQI,"With a new annual report, it's time to take an updated look at RQI. The last year has been rough on REITs, and RQI couldn't escape that downward pressure. The fund is trading at a discount, which can make it worth considering if you're looking for a solid REIT CEF."
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-18T04:20:12-04:00,NFJ,"NFJ takes an approach of primarily investing in equity investments but also incorporates convertible securities.

Nick Ackerman,2023-03-16T22:15:43-04:00,NRGX,"NRGX is an energy fund offered by PIMCO, a fixed-income specialist, so it would appear outside their expertise. However, it isn't your everyday energy fund either, and it incorporates some fixed-income exposure and all the derivatives that come along with PIMCO funds. The fund's deep discount has remained fairly persistent, which means it remains attractive, too."
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-15T21:34:10-04:00,CGO,"Despite the volatility we've seen in the market, CGO has continued to hang on to its narrow discount. The fund's distribution was trimmed last year but remains elevated as a solid rebound hasn't been able to take hold in the broader market. While it might be a great long-term play from a fairly strong management team, it remains a hold rating based on valuation. With that being the case, this is a general update on CGO overall."
Nick Ackerman,2023-03-13T21:32:01-04:00,BSTZ,"Interest rates have continued to wreak havoc on growth plays such as BSTZ.

They can bump up their distribution for shareholders even further after a large increase in 2022 due to the continued benefits of rising rates."

The ETF was launched in May 2007. FIW has outperformed SPY since its May 2007 launch. It also has a higher earnings growth rate and a smaller valuation premium compared to my July and October 2022 reviews. Fundamentals are improving, but the industry faces challenges like shutoff moratoriums imposed during the pandemic that might also occur in a recession. The consensus probability for that event is 65%. More concerning is FIW's low 6.46/10 profitability score, which I believe will disproportionately hurt the fund in a market downturn. I like the direction the fund is moving in, but these risks limit my rating to a hold."

Historical performance is solid, but combining SCHD and VIG is a better choice. Lower fees mean higher distributions, and other key metrics, like earnings growth and valuation, are virtually identical. SCHD and VIG are also higher-quality funds. My fundamental analysis reveals how current selections have delivered superior dividend growth over the last five years, so this approach is a win-win. Given this alternative and how investors often use multiple ETFs to achieve their investment objectives anyway, I rate DTD a hold."

However, I'm surprised by how poorly it performed since, mainly due to high exposure to regional banks. Readers might assume SPYD is a good value play right now. However, it's always a value play, as the strategy merely rotates into poor-performing high-dividend stocks. Compared with other high-dividend ETFs like SCHD and PEY, it's evident the strategy has yet to work. My fundamental analysis doesn't support a buy recommendation either. I don't recommend readers buy SPYD. It's too contrarian of a play right now, and the higher yield isn't worth chasing."

SCHG has highest price-earnings ratio in this sample but also the highest estimated earnings growth rate. Your decision should reflect how quickly you think growth stocks will rebound.

This article will review the ETF's holdings and performance. I included some expert views on the bond market as that could influence when to buy into this ETF. Recent history shows that active management hasn't outpaced its index-based competitors but in 10 years, it was the clear winner. Maybe that mojo will return. As a Core Fixed Income ETF for the US market, I would give the BOND ETF a Buy rating based on its since-inception record."

ALTL beat SPY because the high-beta portfolio was preferable more times. This article demonstrates how readers can save themselves the trouble and fees by investing in the underlying ETFs themselves. This approach has a better chance than ALTL in market downturns. There's also the question of whether SPLV, ALTL's low-volatility choice, is optimal. My performance chart highlighting returns for 18 low-volatility ETFs suggests it's not. I've rated ALTL as a sell because of its poor success rate, sub-optimal selections, and high fees.

Oddly, VFMF has underperformed three other Vanguard ETFs that emphasize these factors individually. In this case, the whole is less than the sum of the parts. This article takes a closer look at VFMF's strategy to explain reasons for the poor performance. The initial volatility screen is suspicious and could inadvertently exclude too many high-potential stocks. My fundamental analysis compares VFMF with Vanguard's three other factor ETFs: VFMO, VFQY, and VFVA. This analysis also revealed a surprising weakness for all funds: poor profitability. I don't recommend readers buy VFMF, but I hope this analysis provides some insight into the strengths and weaknesses of factor-based investing."

Fees are fair at 0.29%, considering how OMFL's five-year trailing returns were among the best of any large-cap fund, including growth-oriented ones. My analysis reveals a few potential flaws in the selection process. For example, its short track record means the strategy is untested in the recovery and contraction phases. It appears the Index goes ""all-in"" on a particular phase, regardless if it's only a minor advantage over another phase. Also, the Index is free to move back and forth between phases rather than progress linearly, as you might expect with a cycle. This was a really hard call to make, complicated by OMFL's outstanding current fundamentals. However, I think it's best for investors to wait until the model is more clear on which phase we're in, so I've given OMFL a firm ""hold"" rating today."

ESGU remains one of the better choices, but only because it's nearly identical to SPY, excluding only 3% of companies by weight. All other key fundamental metrics are similar. There isn't a compelling reason to buy ESGU today. Since S&P 500 ETFs like SPY, IVV, VOO, and SPLG are cheaper, investors should be slightly better off with them in the long run."

One possible reason is that its Index doesn't consider any forward-looking metrics. This feature is evident when analyzing EPS's fundamentals against SPY. Estimated growth rates are lower across the board, though historical growth rates were better. Investors are compensated through a lower valuation based on earnings and cash flow. However, most other key metrics are too similar for there to be a serious opportunity. I'm reiterating my neutral position on EPS but will suggest a more value-oriented ETF worth consideration."

Instead, I recommend readers explore SCHD, VYM, and HDV, three low-cost alternatives with a superior combination of volatility, growth, valuation, yield, and quality. CDC isn't a poor ETF, but it's far from optimal. For this straightforward reason, I've decided to downgrade the fund to a sell."

A total of 25 companies were added, namely AbbVie and Chevron, while IBM was the most prominent deletion. The composition changed, but the overall fundamentals are on solid footing. Investors can expect a 3.77% net yield, and SCHD's latest additions have impressive free cash flow metrics. Key metrics like valuation and profitability remain attractive features. SCHD trades at 15x forward earnings and has an impressive 9.53/10 Profitability Score. These and other metrics are evaluated at the company and industry levels for SCHD pre- and post-reconstitution. Back-tested results for the current portfolio are also provided. Look for the downloadable Excel spreadsheet link under the five key takeaways section.

All three screens are backward-looking, a potential flaw with this historically top-performing ETF. Market sentiment, evidenced by weak earnings surprises and analyst earnings revisions, remains poor. A higher margin of safety is required with a richly-valued ETF like IWY. While I don't recommend investors buy IWY today, this article presents its fundamentals alongside QQQ and SPY."

Since then, however, a lot has changed with ETF investing. As an example, most major brokerages offer commission-free trading, so competition is wide open. In this review, I will return for a second look. This time, however, I will be taking a longer-term view. The challenge, I find, is to incorporate what I may believe important in the near term with a longer-term outlook. I will do my best to summarize both to help readers form their own view."

After a solid 2022, VYM is lagging SPY by approximately 6% in 2023. The concern is that it's not temporary. Negative earnings revisions largely explain the underperformance. Dividend investors shouldn't count on double-digit dividend growth anymore, either. Sales and earnings growth don't support it. On the plus side, VYM features a low 0.89 five-year beta and trades at 15.49x forward earnings, a seven-point discount to SPY. These, as well as other fundamental metrics for SCHD and SPY, are discussed below."

Last January, I recommended readers choose VTV, Vanguard's large-cap value fund instead. The call proved correct, but one year later, the fundamentals aren't so clear. Diversification is a huge benefit. Regional Bank stocks, which have market participants spooked after SVB's collapse, comprise less than 5% of the portfolio. Dividend ETFs tend to have higher exposure. VOE also trades at an attractive 16.40x forward earnings and has superior earnings momentum than VTV. It's a toss-up.

CEO Tim Wallace died last Friday, March 3. He had held that post since the company's inception, and his passing marks the end of an era at CHCT. The company reported mixed Q4 2022 results but maintains an exceptional balance sheet. Occupancy has stabilized in the low 90s, as management anticipated from the outset, and growth prospects remain strong.

Fees are 0.39% and the ETF has $6 billion in assets. The portfolio is solid and well-diversified. However, there are cheaper alternatives with better long-term track records like the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF. Newcomers like OMFL and IUS are also exciting plays with superior short-term track records. In particular, IUS features an excellent balance of growth, value, and profitability. There aren't many significant flaws with PRF, though the lack of a leverage screen could explain recent underperformance. It's a nice factor ETF, but just isn't optimal, so I'm reiterating my hold rating."

However, expected sales and earnings growth is just 6% over the next twelve months. High dividend growth is unsustainable. TDIV also has weak earnings momentum and poor Wall Street sentiment. With a 21.3x forward earnings valuation and a low 2% expected dividend yield, it's unappealing. I don't recommend TDIV stock but will compare its fundamentals alongside TDV, another dividend-focused fund worth exploring."

However, that's irrelevant because FCPI's portfolio turned over significant in the last year. My backtesting highlights how the current iteration doubled in value since December 2019. Considering Index reconstitutions is critical to proper fund analysis. Currently, FCPI trades at a 6.29-point forward earnings discount to SPY, is well-diversified, and less volatile than the market. Readers overweighting sectors like Energy likely have no need for ETFs like FCPI and EQRR. However, if you're seeking a dedicated inflation-protection solution, FCPI is a solid choice."

Performance compared to peers like XLC and VOX is solid, but the sector has historically underperformed the market. FCOM also comes with increased volatility and a poor growth profile. FCOM trades at 20x forward earnings, which is still too high. In addition, Alphabet controls 21% of the portfolio, and it has missed analyst estimates for four straight quarters. This article compares FCOM's fundamentals alongside five other Communication Services ETFs, and we think XTL is where investors should look for growth. Otherwise, avoid overweighting the sector altogether."

Still, its 16.6% exposure to Technology stocks is too high. As a result, FNDX has poor earnings momentum and is at risk of a short-term correction. The sector's recent rally is unsupported by the latest  earnings reports and analyst revisions. This article compares FNDX's fundamentals against IWD, IWB, and IWF, three Russell 1000 Index ETFs tracking the value, blended, and growth segments. In my view, IWD looks superior."
